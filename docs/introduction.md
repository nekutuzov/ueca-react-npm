# Introduction

Welcome to the Unified Encapsulated Component Architecture (UECA) tutorial. UECA is a modern framework designed to create scalable, maintainable, and modular web applications. This introduction will cover the base features of UECA, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of its core principles and benefits.

## What is UECA?

UECA stands for Unified Encapsulated Component Architecture. It is a framework that emphasizes encapsulation, modularity, and maintainability in web development. UECA leverages TypeScript and JSX to create robust and type-safe components, with minimal reliance on React-specific features.

## Base Features of UECA

### TypeScript Integration

TypeScript is the primary language used in UECA development. It provides static typing, enhancing code quality and maintainability. By using TypeScript, developers can catch errors early and enjoy a more robust development experience.

### Minimal React Usage

UECA uses React's custom hooks for component model instantiation, but other React features (like class components, useState, useEffect) are avoided. This minimal reliance on React simplifies the learning curve for developers new to React while leveraging the power of React's component-based architecture.

### Declarative and Modular Code Style

The UECA code style emphasizes a declarative and modular approach. This approach focuses on consistency, encapsulation, and readability, ensuring that components are maintainable and scalable.

### Standard Code Template

To maintain consistency across different components, UECA encourages using [a standard code template](code-template.md). This ensures a uniform structure across the codebase, making it easier to navigate and understand.

### Comprehensive Binding System

UECA provides a comprehensive binding system with three types of bindings:
1. **Unidirectional Binding**: Reflects the value of a property without allowing modifications.
2. **Bidirectional Binding**: Synchronizes state between two properties, allowing changes to propagate in both directions.
3. **Custom Binding**: Provides flexibility to transform values during the binding process.

### View Rules and Patterns

UECA has specific rules for handling views:
- **View-Type Methods**: Methods returning JSX should end with "View" to become observers of all observable dependencies.
- **View-Type Properties**: Properties storing JSX should end with "View" to avoid rendering issues and potential application crashes.
- **Rendering**: Use `UEC.renderNode(model.someView)` for methods returning `ReactNode` and `<model.someView />` for those returning `JSX.Element`.

### Messaging System

UECA includes a messaging system that allows components to communicate in a decoupled manner. Components can send and receive messages without direct dependencies, promoting a modular architecture.

### Lifecycle Management

UECA components have lifecycle methods (`init`, `mount`, `unmount`) to manage initialization, mounting, and unmounting processes. These methods ensure that resources are appropriately managed throughout the component's lifecycle.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a core principle of UECA. Each component encapsulates its implementation details, exposing only necessary interfaces. This reduces code complexity and enhances maintainability.

## Conclusion

UECA is a powerful framework designed to create maintainable, scalable, and modular web applications. By leveraging TypeScript, minimizing React usage, and following a declarative and modular code style, UECA provides a robust foundation for modern web development. This tutorial will guide you through the core features of UECA, helping you build efficient and maintainable applications.
